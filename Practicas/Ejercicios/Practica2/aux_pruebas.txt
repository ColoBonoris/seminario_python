Well this is what it look like right before you fall
Stumblin' around, you've been guessin' your direction
Next step you can't see at all
And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no
Who am I to blame, who am I to blame though?
And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no
Trust me, I've tried
I just end up right at the start of the line
Drawin' circles
Well I drink my whiskey, you sip your wine
Went through a wall, sittin',
Watchin' the world falling down its decline
And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe
Do not be afraid, do not be afraid
You're feelin' sorry, I'm feelin' fine
Don't you put any more stress on yourself
It's one day at a time
It's gettin' pretty late, gettin' pretty late
And I find it goes around like the hands that keep countin' the time
Drawin' circles
